1. how do languages solve for this floating point issue? ex. BigDecimal
2. certain languages don't support threading

byte - unit of addressable RAM (standard now is 8 bits)

in a 32 bit system ->
it means each of the registers is 32bits
(this means an address can only be 1-4 billion, each 1 byte so 4 billion bytes = 4 GB)

we moved to 64bits to support a greater number of addresses


RIS
reduced instruction set
(used as an optimization for machines that perform a limited / specific set of instruction (ex. phones))
